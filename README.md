# How do I make other plugins support Cookiebot?
If you favourite plugins doesnâ€™t support Cookiebot you are always welcome to ask the author to add support for Cookiebot.
Cookiebot provides a helper function to check if there is an active, working version of Cookiebot on the website.
The easiest way for at developer to implement Cookiebot support is to add a check for Cookiebot where tags are outputted to the visitor. 

This can be done following way;

```php
$scriptTag = ";
if(function_exists('cookiebot_active') && cookiebot_active()) {
$scriptTag = '<script'.cookiebot_assist('statistics').'>';
}
```

A users consent state can be be aquired through Cookiebots JS API:

The following properties are available on the CookieConsent object:

| Name                | Type | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

And through PHP:

```php
if (isset($_COOKIE["CookieConsent"]))
{
    switch ($_COOKIE["CookieConsent"])
    {
        case "0":
            //The user has not accepted cookies - set strictly necessary cookies only
            break;

        case "-1":
            //The user is not within a region that requires consent - all cookies are accepted
            break;

        default: //The user has accepted one or more type of cookies
            
            //Read current user consent in encoded JavaScript format
            $valid_php_json = preg_replace('/\s*:\s*([a-zA-Z0-9_]+?)([}\[,])/', ':"$1"$2', preg_replace('/([{\[,])\s*([a-zA-Z0-9_]+?):/', '$1"$2":', str_replace("'", '"',stripslashes($_COOKIE["CookieConsent"]))));
            $CookieConsent = json_decode($valid_php_json);

            if (filter_var($CookieConsent->preferences, FILTER_VALIDATE_BOOLEAN))
            {
                //Current user accepts preference cookies
            }
            else
            {
                //Current user does NOT accept preference cookies
            }

            if (filter_var($CookieConsent->statistics, FILTER_VALIDATE_BOOLEAN))
            {
                //Current user accepts statistics cookies
            }
            else
            {
                //Current user does NOT accept statistics cookies
            }

            if (filter_var($CookieConsent->marketing, FILTER_VALIDATE_BOOLEAN))
            {
                //Current user accepts marketing cookies
            }
            else
            {
                //Current user does NOT accept marketing cookies
            }   
    }
}
else
{
    //The user has not accepted cookies - set strictly necessary cookies only
}
