# How do I make other plugins support Cookiebot?
If you favourite plugins doesnâ€™t support Cookiebot you are always welcome to ask the author to add support for Cookiebot.
Cookiebot provides a helper function to check if there is an active, working version of Cookiebot on the website.
The easiest way for at developer to implement Cookiebot support is to add a check for Cookiebot where tags are outputted to the visitor. 

This can be done following way;

```php
$scriptTag = ";
if(function_exists('cookiebot_active') && cookiebot_active()) {
$scriptTag = '<script'.cookiebot_assist('statistics').'>';
}
```
